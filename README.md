## Runing on Mock server

For mocking we use **Mirage.js**
The server is established in **development** environment automatically and runs on the same port as the frontend code 
where it intercepts all the requests and api calls and mocks their responses through defined routes

## Runing on real server
When deployed in a **Production environment**, the **Mirage** server is not established and it doesn't intercept the calls to the api
The publicPath is taken form the domain name where the project runs

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
